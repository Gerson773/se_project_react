# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Title

WTWR Is The Title of the application

## Overview

This website was created to help the user recommend which items to wear based on their location and weather.

## Features

The user is able to add items based on wether types, which can the be updated automatically in the home screen to help the user determine what to wear. The automated selection of items is computed by the app to make this process easier for the user.

## Main Screen

The main screen shows the recommended items based on the current weather. It also shows the current weather in Farenheit and Celsius. A temperaturre unit switch was created using React Router to switch from F to C. Also an Add Items button is located in the Main screen to help the user add items if needed.

## Adding Items

Adding items is simple by following the steps below:

1. Open the website
2. Click on +Add Clothes at the top right of the page
3. Form opens
4. The user submits the information and selects Weather Type.
5. After clicking on "Add garment" the item is added to site for future or current use

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
